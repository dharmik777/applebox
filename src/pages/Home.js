      Hi, I'm Dharmik! Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a web developer/designer with a knack for creating fresh new
            websites for you and/or yor company. My road to web developing has been a bit winding, and I definitely
            took a step or two off the beaten path but it all lead to this. I have a passion for the arts and actually
            got my MFA from Louisana State University; so, now I use that artistic passion, curiousity, and intrigue to
            excel as a web developer! Did I mention that I am also a freelance photographer? Well I am. I mostly do
            portraits and headshots, but shoot the occasional wedding, event or promotional material as well. Click on
            the "Portfolio" link to check out my work and then contact me if you'd like me to design your website and/or
            take the pictures that'll go on it!.
